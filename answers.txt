What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?

• What does fast-forward in Git mean?
Git does a fast forward  when the branch has no divergent work to merge. For eg : If master is behind the feature branch by certain number of commits git does a fast forward to the latest change and skip the merge part. 

• Why should you have different branches?
We have different branches to make sure the code works. When a development team makes all their changes in a single branch it can result in lot of conflicts as well as the code can break at any point.
It is safe practice to have a master branch, a development branch and other feature branches. 

• In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
It depends on the size of the project as well as the team. For a small project we can have a single repository for a project.
But if the size of the project increases we can have multiple repositories splitting up the project and each sub team working on the project can use
their repository.
